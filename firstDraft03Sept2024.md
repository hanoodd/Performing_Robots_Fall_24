Shark Tank: Parody:  
  
The idea is there are entrepreneurs pitching their inventions to a panel
of investors. The ideas will be really impractical and stupid like "Pet
Rock 2.0" or "The Non-Stick Sticky Notes". The entrepreneurs will try to
seriously pitch their ideas and act like the investors concerns are out
of proportion. The inventions could also be things incorporated into the
robot, so you can see in real time how dumb they are.  
  
Act 1: Introduce the panel of judges.  
  
Act 2: First dumb pitch with entrepreneur. The investors hope there are
better ideas.  
  
Act 3: Second dumb pitch with entrepreneur. The investors start to go
crazy.  
  
Act 4: Third dumb pitch with entrepreneur. The investors go insane and
decide to invest.
