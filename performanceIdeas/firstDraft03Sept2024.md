Shark Tank: Parody:  

The idea is there are entrepreneurs pitching their inventions to a panel
of investors. The ideas will be really impractical and stupid like "Pet
Rock 2.0" or "The Non-Stick Sticky Notes". The entrepreneurs will try to
seriously pitch their ideas and act like the investors concerns are out
of proportion. The inventions could also be things incorporated into the
robot, so you can see in real time how dumb they are.  

Characters:
Mr. Awful: Kevin O'Leary Replica. (Mr Wonderful) Ruthless, and obsessed with money. He will make dramatic statements about the harsh realities of business. Offers deals that benefit him. "What's in it for me?"

Barbara Cordial: Barbara Replica. Supportive and overly nice. Overcome by the story.

Mark Cubic: Mark Cuban Replica. Outbids other investors. Makes big deals. Passionate Visionary.

Chad: Dresses like Steve Jobs. Thinks he's like him. Insane confidence with his mediocre invention. Thinks its revolutionary. He likes style over substance. He thinks the investors just "dont get it" when they express doubt. He pitches a "smart" mug which is just a mug with a clock.

Nina: Timid and unconfident. Apologizes for her nervousness. Amazing idea, but she ends up running away before investors can confirm deals. She pitches a biodegradable alternative to straws.

Steven: Hippie and spiritual character who doesn't think about making profit from his business, just about the vibes.

Chloe: Analytical character. No emotion to her pitch, just lots of data and hard to understand technical jargon. She's detail oriented and a bit too serious.
